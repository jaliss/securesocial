h1. SecureSocial Module for Play! Framework Applications

SecureSocial allows you to add an authentication UI to your app that works with services based on OAuth1, OAuth2, OpenID and OpenID+OAuth hybrid protocols.

It also provides a Username and Password mechanism for users that do not wish to use existing accounts in other networks.

The following services are supported in this release:

* Twitter (OAuth1)
* Facebook (OAuth2)
* Google (OpenID)
* Google (OpenID + OAuth Hybrid)
* Google (OAuth2)
* GitHub (OAuth2)
* Yahoo (OpenID + OAuth Hybrid)
* LinkedIn (OAuth1)
* Foursquare (OAuth2)
* MyOpenID (OpenID)
* Wordpress (OpenID)
* Username and Password

The module does not depend on any external Java libray. It relies only on what the Play! Framework provides and uses the awesome <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap toolkit from Twitter</a> to style the UI.  

There is a live demo at <a href="http://securesocial-jaliss.rhcloud.com/">http://securesocial-jaliss.rhcloud.com</a>. You can try all the providers there except the Username and Password one because the app cannot send emails on that server.
