master
		- added Instagram Providers (thanks @poornerd)
		- added Foursquare (tm) and XING Providers (thanks @poornerd)
		- Added VK provider (thanks @KonstantinGrigoriev)
		- Static files injection to SecureSocial (thanks @pvillega).
		- Option to auto-login after completing signup (thanks @platypii).
2.0.10  - 2013-02-06
		- Changed the save() method in UserService to return an Identity so that event callback implementations can receive Identity instances from custom classes.
		- Added an event API that can be used to track events(only login/logout yet). Scala only for now.
2.0.9	- 2013-01-25
		- The login action redirects the user to the app if he is already authenticated now

2.0.8   - 2013-01-01
		- PasswordHasher and Password validator are abstract classes instead of traits now (simplifies Java integration).
		- Fixed: wrong LinkedIn key for getting fullName (thanks @chazmcgarvey).
		- Removed servceInfo from OAuth1Info. That object can be retrieved from SecureSocial.serviceInfoFor method now.
		- Backward incompatible changes to the Java API: deleted AuthenticationMethod, OAuth1Info, OAuth2Info, PasswordInfo, SocialUser and UserId. This was required because after introducing the Identity trait I need to make sure the user gets its own object in the actions instead of a SocialUser instance.  Even though there's not a Java equivalent, the Scala classes can be called from Java easily.
		- Added new message to messages file: securesocial.login.errorLoggingIn
		- Improved ProviderController.handleAuth to show an error if an error occurrs while logging the user in (eg: if the UserService.save implemewntation throws an exception)
		- Fixed: Identity providers were filling wrong provider id values
		- Added: UsernamePasswordProvider updates the user avatar if gravatar support is enabled now.
		- Added timeout for sessions (30 mins by default, use sessionTimeOut property to change). 
		- Fixed: PasswordValidator was not being used in password reset
		- Fixed: When a token is expired the user is properly redirected to the sign up or reset pages now
		- Added enableTokenJob property to enable/disable the background job
		- Fixed method typo AuthenticationMethod: toScala.
		- Right http codes are returned for ajax calls now 
		- New assetsController property to override the assets class in RoutesHelper. Needed when a custom Asset controller is used by the app.  
		- Added hasher id to PasswordInfo
		- Added support for registering multiple PasswordHashers to allow upgrading the hashing algorithm.
		- Introduced Identity trait. SocialUser now implements it (this will allow developers to return their own user class from UserService.find methods)
2.0.7	- 2012-11-25		
		- Added password change functionality
		- Changed SecureSocial.currentUser/userFromSession methods to support websockets (thanks @KimStevel for catching this)

		- Added documentation for password plugins
		- Added base class for Java based password hashers: BasePasswordHasher
		- Added PasswordValidator to allow customization of password rules/strength
		- Added DefaultPasswordValidator that enforces the length of passwords
